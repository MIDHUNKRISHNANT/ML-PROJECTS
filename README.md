The Boston Housing Dataset is a derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston MA.
The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and there are 506 entries representing aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston

BOSTON DATASET 
Boston Housing Dataset Attribute Information (in order):
        - CRIM     PER CAPITA CRIME RATE BY TOWN
        - ZN       proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
        - INDUS    proportion of non-retail business acres per town
        - CHAS     Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
        - NOX      nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
        - RM       average number of rooms per dwelling
        - AGE      proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
        - DIS      weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
        - RAD      index of accessibility to radial highways
        - TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
        - PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
        - B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
        - LSTAT    %lower status of the population
        - MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's


LIBRARIES  USED IN THIS PROJECT:
1-PANDAS- It is a  library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

2-MATPLOTLIB-Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

3-SEABORN-Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing             attractive and informative statistical graphics.

4-SCIKIT-LEARN-It is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.It features various                     classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient               boosting,k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy           and SciPy.


ML AGORITHMS USED:

1-LINEAR REGRESSION-Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression                       task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables.
